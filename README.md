# Demo
- You could add a demo video here
- Or link to your presentation video of the project

# Conclusion
The project turns to be very useful for individual investor with the key information presented in the dashboard and regular update.
The biggest challenge would be finding the relevant data that complement such analysis of an area such as crime data, demography, etc.
The other challenge would be the limitation of each of data source API how many request that can be made during certain amount of time, finding the optimal request would be the trade off between how much we will get then also how fast the data collection can be done.
